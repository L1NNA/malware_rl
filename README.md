# Multi-Agent Network for Adversarial Attack Detection

# Setup
install all dependancies needed to train the network:

```pip install -r requirements```

Please ensure you have the following dependencies: 
- [LIEF](https://lief.quarkslab.com/)

- Download a set of Microsoft PE malware and a set of benignware from online.

## Dataset
The dataset that was prcoured throughout this project can not be provide. My data is mostly malware and it is not a very good practice to provide malware to the world through a GitHub repo, so becuase of that I do not provide any of my dataset here.

## Running 

To train the modifcation agent:

```cd h4rm0ny```

```python -m h4rm0ny --agent acer```

Running this command will produce train an acer agent that is saved in the acer directory. This command will also produce the modified verson of the dataset.

To train the detection agent please go through ```Exepriment.ipynb```
